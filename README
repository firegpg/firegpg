FireGPG
=======

FireGPG is no longer supported, the original author abandoned the project. See: [blog.getfiregpg.org/discontinued](http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2010/06/07/firegpg-discontinued/)

We simply grabbed a copy of the code and made it available on GitHub.

You can build an XPI for installation by running the build.sh script located in this folder.

For development you should do the following:

1. Unzip the entire contents of this package to somewhere,
    e.g, c:\dev or /home/user/dev
2. Put the full path to the folder (e.g. c:\dev\firegpg on
   Windows, /home/user/dev/firegpg on Linux) in a file named
   firegpg@firegpg.team and copy that file to
   [your profile folder]\extensions\
3. Restart Firefox.

Pull Requests are welcome and they will be accepted, but we will not be performing much (if any) testing on them.

Several people from the FireGPG community have banded together and are working on two
new projects.  One is a replacement for FireGPG that will apparently initially target
the Chrome web browser from Google and then be released for Firefox.
The second is gpgAuth which is available for Chrome. (https://github.com/gpgauth)
