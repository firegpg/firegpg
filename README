FireGPG
=======

FireGPG is no longer supported, the original author abandoned the project. See: [blog.getfiregpg.org/discontinued](http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2010/06/07/firegpg-discontinued/)

We simply grabbed a copy of the code and made it available on GitHub.

There are newer, better extensions for both Firefox and Chrome.
