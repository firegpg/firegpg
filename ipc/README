ipc needs to be build on each platform

./get.sh this checks out ipc code and patches it for use this extension
./build_* build scripts for each platform, expects mozilla-central in ~/src/

after building you need to move all files in:
 components/                 to extension/components/
 ipc*/modules/subprocess.jsm to extension/modules/subprocess.jsm

add contents of chrome.manifest to extension/chrome.manifest
